/*
 *  Class: CMSC203 CRN 30339
 Program: Assignment #1 Design
 Instructor: Professor Grinberg
 Summary of Description: Develops a program that will test the extra sensory perception that will generate random numbers assigned to colors. The program reads user input to guess the colors 11 times and displays the number of correct guesses. 
 Due Date: 2/12/2024
 Platform/Compiler: Java
 Integrity Pledge: I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
